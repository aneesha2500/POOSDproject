This project is a web application solving the Travelling salesman problem. 

The user can enter a start time, start location, up to twenty stops and times at each stop, and an ending location.

Once the trip is submitted, the optimized order of stops and more detailed information about each leg of the route (ETA and distance) will be shown, along with a map.

Note that the API key will need to be changed in both poosd.html (in the first script tag) and in server.js (near the top of the file). 

You must have Node, Express, Axios, and Cors installed in your directory to run server.js. 

Use "node server.js" to start up the backend and open poosd.html in your browser to run the web app.
